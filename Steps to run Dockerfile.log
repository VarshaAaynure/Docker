## Steps to run docker file
1. Create folder and it should be named as "Dockerfile" on your VM (not in container)
2. Then inside this folder copy your "Dockerfile" 
# Note: your folder should contain only one dokcerfile
# if not, then we will need to mention dockerfile name
3. run: docker build -t container-name .
 or docker build -t $container_id .
